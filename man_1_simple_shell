.TH _SIMPLE_SHELL 3 "December 2025" "Holberton Project" "User Manual"

.SH NAME
hsh \- Minimal UNIX command interpreter in C.

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "shell.h"

int main(int ac, char **av, char **env);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBhsh\fR programme is a simplified UNIX command interpreter.
It displays an interactive prompt, reads a command from standard input,
creates a child process and attempts to execute the corresponding executable
via the \fBexecve(2)\fR system call, passing it the environment.

It is a deliberately minimal version of a shell, designed as part of
a system programming project.

.SS Operation
At each iteration, the shell:
.TP
1. Displays a prompt (only if the standard input is a terminal).
.TP
2. Reads a command line (terminated by a line break).
.TP
3. Creates a child process with \fBfork(2)\fR.
.TP
4. Executes the command in the child process with \fBexecve(2)\fR.
.TP
5. Waits for the child process to finish in the parent with \fBwaitpid(2)\fR.
.TP
6. Redisplays the prompt after execution (successful or not).

.SS Error handling
The shell handles the following in particular:
.IP \(bu 2
Command not found (invalid path or file does not exist).
.IP \(bu 2
Process creation failed (\fBfork()\fR).
.IP \(bu 2
Insufficient permissions (\fBX_OK\fR required to run the programme).

If the executable cannot be launched, an error message is displayed
and the shell continues to run.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The programme ends with the code:
.TP
\fB0\fR
Whether the output comes from an EOF (Ctrl+D) or a normal end.
.PP
The return code of executed commands is not retrieved for reuse in the shell.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
#include "shell.h"

int main(void)
{
    /* Launch the shell in interactive mode */
    system("./hsh");

    /* Example of valid execution */
    /* User input: /bin/pwd */
    /* Expected output: (path to the current directory) */

    /* Example of invalid execution */
    /* User input: ls */
    /* Expected output: ./hsh: No such file or directory */

    return (0);
}
.fi

.SH NOTES
This implementation does not support :
.IP \(bu 2
Automatic resolution via \fBPATH\fR (no arguments accepted without a path).
.IP \(bu 2
Built-ins (\fBcd\fR, \fBexit\fR, \fBenv\fR, etc.).
.IP \(bu 2
Redirections, pipes, separators, or special character expansions.
.IP \(bu 2
Moving the cursor or intercepting keyboard keys (arrows, etc.).
.IP \(bu 2
Commands with multiple arguments.

This shell is not intended for use in production and remains an educational programme.

.SH BUGS
Deliberately limited programme. Keyboard escape sequences are
read as plain text and may cause execution errors,
which is consistent with the expected behaviour of a minimal shell.
